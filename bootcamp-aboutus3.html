  <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
  <h3>Welcome to our World! (it’s weird here)</h3>
     <p> After the initial shock and excitement of seeing those two little lines on the pee stick, the journey toward motherhood became a huge enigma. You mean I have to keep feeding the newborn every few hours day AND night? What muscles do I use when they ask you to “push”? And how exactly does one get poop stains out of car upholstery?
  </p>

    <p> babies can be a wild, beautiful journey. After all, you’re bringing another tiny human into this world who is completely dependent on you and who will be your biggest fan. As the baby grows, so will your heart, and so will your expenses. Although, the tax deductions don’t hurt....
        </p>

    <p> We are two just regular girls turned moms who are figuring it out along the way. If we can do it, trust us, so can you! We want to make things easier for new moms (and dads), convey every thought that’s probably gone through your head, and hopefully put you at ease. Our goal is to share helpful information, promote discussion, squash mommy-guilt, and make you laugh. 
    </p>
     
   <p> There is tons of information on the internet, and yet, we always found ourselves asking other moms, family, and friends if things sounded on track. Unlike many sources out there, we want to tackle the hard stuff and give it to you real. There is nothing off the table. Want to know about a specific topic? Send us a message and we promise to review it and share our experience, or do our best to find you resources that can help. 
    </p>
    
    <p> We will be sharing blogs every week covering all sorts of topics -- from the mundane to the perplexing. All of our content is based on personal views so please make sure you always check with your doctor about specific situations related to your little Munchkin or Monkey. </p>
    
    
    <p>We are here to empower each other and at the end of the day, every mom has their own style so please, show respect to one another and be open to others’ perspectives. So whether you’re a mom-to-be feverishly researching before the looming due date, or a frazzled parent Googling on the go, welcome. Let’s crush this mom thing!</p>
